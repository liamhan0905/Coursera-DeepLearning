### Key points from "Convolution_model_Step_by_Step" project assignment (Week 1)

- Implemented convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, forward propagation, without using Tensorflow

### Key points from "Convolution_model_Application" project assignment (Week 1)
- Built a model that recognizes SIGN language with almost 80% accuracy on the test set. For this assignment Tensorflow was used.


### Key points from "Keras Tutorial" project assignment (Week 2)
- Used Keras to build a model that recognizes whether a person is smiling or not smiling through images.
