### Key points from "Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset" project assignment (Week 1)
- Used logistic regression calssifier to predict image of a cat
- Preprocessing the dataset is important.
- You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
- Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!
 
### Key points from "Planar data classification with one hidden layer" project assignment (Week 2)
- Built a complete neural network with a hidden layer
- Made a good use of a non-linear unit
- Implemented forward propagation and backpropagation, and trained a neural network
- See the impact of varying the hidden layer size, including overfitting.

### Key points from "Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step: Application" project assignment (Week 3)
- Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

### Key points from "Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application" project assignment (Week 4)
- 4-layer neural network has better performance (80%) than your 2-layer neural network (72%) on the same test set
