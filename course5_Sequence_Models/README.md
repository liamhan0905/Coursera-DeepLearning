### Key points from "Building a Recurrent Neural Network" project assignment (Week 1)

- Implemented a forward pass for the basic RNN and LSTM

### Key points from "Dinosaurus Island Character Level Language Model Final" project assignment (Week 1)

- Built a character level language model to generate new dinosaurus names.

### Key points from "Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network" project assignment (Week 1)

- Implemented a model that uses an LSTM to generate music
- A sequence model can be used to generate musical values, which are then post-processed into midi music.
- Fairly similar models can be used to generate dinosaur names or to generate music, with the major difference being the input fed to the model.
- In Keras, sequence generation involves defining layers with shared weights, which are then repeated for the different time steps  1,…,Tx1,…,Tx .
